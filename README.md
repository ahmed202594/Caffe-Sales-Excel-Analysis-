## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the data analysis, the following actions are recommended to improve profitability:

1.  **Marketing Focus:**
    * Capitalize on **Milk-based drinks** (Latte/Cappuccino) by introducing new flavors (Vanilla, Hazelnut).
    * Launch **"Summer Cool Offers"** in July to counter the seasonal sales drop.

2.  **Operational Efficiency:**
    * Optimize staffing during **10 AM - 11 AM** and **4 PM** to handle peak traffic.
    * Consider reducing operating hours late at night (after 9 PM) or switching to delivery-only to save costs.

3.  **Pricing Strategy:**
    * Slight price increase (3-5%) on top-selling items (Latte) in peak months (March/Oct) is feasible.
    * Reposition **Espresso** as a premium product rather than discounting it.

4.  **Weekend Traffic:**
    * Create specific **Weekend Bundles** to boost low sales on Saturdays and Sundays.
